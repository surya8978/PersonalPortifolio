     <p>Subhash Chandra Bose was Indian freedom fighters and the cause of Indian freedom. He was known as Netaji. He was the President of Indian National Congress (INC) from 1938 to 1939. He attempted to get rid of British rule in India during World War II with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Netaji's attempt was partially successful. He was also recognised as the person who founded the Azad Hind Army or Indian National Army with the help of Japan in 1942.

Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack and died in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945. But many Indians believed that he didn't die that time. The Government of West Bengal submitted many pieces of evidence that he was not alive after the plane crash.</p>
